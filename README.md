These are the **complete downloadable code examples** for my books, _iOS 10 Programming Fundamentals With Swift_ (<http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920055211.do>) and _Programming iOS 10_ (<http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920055235.do>).

**Status of Book 1**: The examples for the first book, _iOS 10 Programming Fundamentals With Swift_, have been _completely_ revised for Xcode 8, Swift 3, and iOS 10.

**Status of Book 2**: The examples for the second book, _Programming iOS 10_, have been _partially_ revised for Xcode 8, Swift 3, and iOS 10. As of this writing, revision is complete _up through chapter 18_.

Example code _after_ book 2, chapter 18 probably won't even compile using the current version of Xcode and Swift, and has not been revised for iOS 10. I'm working on those examples now.

If you find these examples helpful and you haven't purchased the books, please consider doing so.

The downloadable code for the three previous editions has been moved off to subfolders "iOS9bookExamples", "iOS8bookExamples" and "iOS7bookExamples". The code for the earlier editions has been removed.
