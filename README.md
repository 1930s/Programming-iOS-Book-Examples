These are the **complete downloadable code examples** for my books, _iOS 12 Programming Fundamentals With Swift_ (<http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920208655.do>) and _Programming iOS 12_ (<http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920208662.do>).

Examples have been completely revised for Xcode 10, Swift 4.2, and iOS 12.

If you find these examples helpful and you haven't purchased the books, please consider doing so.

The downloadable code for previous editions has been moved off to subfolders "iOS11bookExamples", "iOS10bookExamples", "iOS9bookExamples", "iOS8bookExamples" and "iOS7bookExamples". The code for the earlier editions has been removed.
